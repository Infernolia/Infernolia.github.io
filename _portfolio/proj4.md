GPU Bootcamps are organized regularly to encourage the use of new technologies in  HPC & AI. The Accelerated Data Science part of this material contains a comprehensive coverage of RAPIDS AI framework and demonstrates how to use RAPIDS AI for data science and machine learning projects. The tutorial demonstrates how complex projects can easily be scaled and implemented on mulit-GPU workstations to save computation time.
