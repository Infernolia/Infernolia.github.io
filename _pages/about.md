I am a fourth year undergraduate studuent pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Computer Engineering at SCTR's Pune Institute of Computer Technology, affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University. I enjoy designing efficient computer vision architectures and reinforcement learning models for versatile AI systems. Contributing towards AI for social good is close to my heart and I will always strive to making the world a better place with inclusive technology. Besides machine learning, I have a fondness for poetry and sharp cheese!
